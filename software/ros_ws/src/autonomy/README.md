## Autonomy Package

This ROS2 package is intended to cover functionality to:

- create maps of the locally experienced environment from sensor data (lidar and depth cameras)
- determine navigability of the map for large rovers
- localisation of the rover in its known map
- support self-driving to human-selected waypoints
- implement self-driving exploration routines to explore the local area
- implement self-correction activities for loss of network events
- create heatmaps of network connectivity for display to operators
- monitor and generate position related status events (e.g. lost traction and bogged"

# KeePass2 — Download & Usage Instructions

## Purpose

This short guide explains how to download KeePass2 and open the file that contains the team passwords. Keep this document for reference and follow the security note at the end.

## 1 Download KeePass2

1. Visit the KeePass2 project page on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ keepass
2. Download the latest release suitable for your operating system.
3. Install the application following the usual installer prompts.

## 2 Open the Password File

1. After launching KeePass2, choose Open → Open the file provided with the passwords.
2. The password file is hosted on the team’s GitHub repository. If you cannot find it there, ask a team lead to provide it.
3. When prompted for the master password, enter the password supplied by a lead.

## 3 Security Notes

• Keep the master password limited to leads only. Do not share it with others.
• If anyone outside the leads discovers the password, inform a core team member immediately so the password file and master password can be rotated/changed.
• Store the password file and any exported backups in secure, access-controlled locations (e.g. team GitHub if repository access is restricted, or a protected cloud storage with limited access).
• All new passwords to be added must be sent to a Core Three Member so they can update the KeePass file.

:::{note}
If you have trouble downloading or opening the file, contact one of the leads or a core team member for assistance.

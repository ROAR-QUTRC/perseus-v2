# Quick Start

To teleoperate with an Xbox controller, with Perseus-Lite powered up you will need to run

## Terminal 1

```console
nix shell
ros2 launch perseus_lite perseus_lite.launch.py cmd_vel_topic:=/joy_vel
```

Note the use of /jou_vel is only necessary until the mux code and the perseus-lite branches are merged.

## Terminal 2

```console
nix run .#xbox_controller
```

# Basic Operation

This guide covers the basic teleoperation of Perseus-Lite using keyboard control. Perseus-Lite is a simplified version of Perseus that provides essential rover functionality with streamlined hardware and software requirements.

## Prerequisites

The following conditions must be met before beginning:

- The laptop runs a Linux distribution with the latest code from the perseus-v2 Github repository:
  ```console
  git checkout main
  git pull
  ```
- Perseus-Lite hardware is connected via USB (typically `/dev/ttyACM0`)
- Perseus-Lite has sufficient battery charge or is powered by a 12V power supply

## Summary

1. Connect Perseus-Lite hardware
2. Build the software using Nix
3. Launch Perseus-Lite system
4. Launch control software
5. Operate Perseus-Lite safely

## Hardware Connection

1. Connect Perseus-Lite's USB cable to your laptop
2. Verify the connection:
   ```console
   ls /dev/ttyACM*
   ```
   You should see `/dev/ttyACM0` or similar device listed

## Software Setup

### Build the Software

Build the Perseus-Lite software using Nix:

```console
cd perseus-v2
nix build
```

### Launch Perseus-Lite System

Launch the Perseus-Lite ROS2 system:

```console
export LC_ALL=C && export LANG=C
nix develop --command bash -c "cd software/ros_ws && source install/setup.bash && ros2 launch perseus_lite perseus_lite.launch.py"
```

:::{note}
The system will automatically configure the 4 ST3215 servos and start the communication thread. You should see messages indicating successful servo configuration.
:::

### Verify System Status

Open a new terminal and verify the system is running:

```console
export LC_ALL=C && export LANG=C
nix develop --command bash -c "source software/ros_ws/install/setup.bash && ros2 topic list"
```

You should see topics including:

- `/cmd_vel` - Command velocity input
- `/joint_states` - Real-time servo positions and velocities
- `/diff_drive_base_controller/odom` - Odometry data

Check joint states to verify servo feedback:

```console
export LC_ALL=C && export LANG=C
nix develop --command bash -c "source software/ros_ws/install/setup.bash && ros2 topic echo /joint_states --once"
```

## Control Software Launch

### Keyboard Control

In a new terminal, launch keyboard teleoperation:

```console
cd perseus-v2
export LC_ALL=C && export LANG=C
nix develop --command bash -c "source software/ros_ws/install/setup.bash && ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard"
```

#### Keyboard Controls

The keyboard control interface provides the following commands:

- **Movement Controls:**

  - `i` - Move forward
  - `k` - Stop
  - `,` - Move backward
  - `j` - Turn left
  - `l` - Turn right
  - `u` - Forward + left
  - `o` - Forward + right
  - `m` - Backward + left
  - `.` - Backward + right

- **Speed Controls:**
  - `q/z` - Increase/decrease linear speed by 10%
  - `w/x` - Increase/decrease angular speed by 10%

:::{note}
Control messages are only sent when the terminal with keyboard teleoperation has focus and receives keystrokes. Press `k` to stop movement.
:::

### Xbox Controller (Alternative)

If you prefer Xbox controller input:

```console
cd perseus-v2
export LC_ALL=C && export LANG=C
nix develop --command bash -c "source software/ros_ws/install/setup.bash && ros2 launch input_devices xbox_controller.launch.py"
```

## Safe Operation

### Safety Protocol

Before operating Perseus-Lite:

1. Ensure the operating area is clear of obstacles
2. Keep the Perseus-Lite system within sight
3. Be ready to stop operation immediately if needed
4. Monitor the terminal for any error messages

### Initial Testing

Test Perseus-Lite's movement systematically:

1. Begin with slow speeds
2. Test forward and backward motion separately from turning
3. Verify movement matches expected directions
4. Check that the stop command (`k`) works immediately

### Stopping Operation

To stop Perseus-Lite operation:

1. Press `k` in the keyboard control terminal to stop movement
2. Press `Ctrl+C` in the keyboard control terminal to exit
3. Press `Ctrl+C` in the Perseus-Lite system terminal to shutdown

### Troubleshooting

If Perseus-Lite is not responding:

1. Check that the USB connection is secure
2. Verify `/dev/ttyACM0` is accessible
3. Check the Perseus-Lite system terminal for error messages
4. Restart the Perseus-Lite system if necessary

Common issues:

- **No servo response**: Check USB connection and power
- **Permission denied on /dev/ttyACM0**: Add user to dialout group or use sudo
- **Locale warnings**: Use `export LC_ALL=C && export LANG=C` before commands

## System Shutdown

To properly shutdown Perseus-Lite:

1. Stop all movement commands
2. Press `Ctrl+C` in the keyboard control terminal
3. Press `Ctrl+C` in the Perseus-Lite system terminal
4. Disconnect the USB cable
5. Power down Perseus-Lite hardware

# Perseus's URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Overview

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is an XML-based file format, central to the Robot Operating System (ROS) and other robotics tools, used to describe a robot's physical structure, including its rigid bodies (links) and how they connect and move (joints), defining its kinematics, visuals, and physical properties for simulation and control. It acts as a digital blueprint, detailing each part's geometry, mass, and relationship, making robots understandable and usable in software like Gazebo and RViz [^1]

# Except highly specialised for our use case, and with no --auto-display because that breaks everything somehow.
# With that flag, xvfb-run doesn't work - it doesn't actually run any commands.
# Perhaps because it's in a Wayland environment not X11, and thus there's no pre-existing X server to talk to?
# -a works, but supposedly it's deprecated. Very strange. Running it with no flags works too, so that's what we do.
